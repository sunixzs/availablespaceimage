beryllium/icelus -> forked to sunixz/availablespaceimage
========================================================

Big thanks to Kevin Boyd  providing all the stuff as entrypoint to get this working :-)

Fork of beryllium/icelus to get a special image-tag for Twig in Sculpin.

Maybe documentation comes later when the current project is stable.
